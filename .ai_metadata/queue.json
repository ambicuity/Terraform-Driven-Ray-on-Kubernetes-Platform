      "priority": "high",
      "brief": "The Node Termination Handler (NTH) currently uses `AmazonSQSFullAccess`, violating least privilege. This issue proposes refactoring NTH IAM permissions to a tightly scoped policy allowing only necessary SQS actions on a dedicated, explicitly provisioned SQS queue for NTH events, routed via EventBridge. This enhances security by minimizing the blast radius of a compromised NTH pod.",
