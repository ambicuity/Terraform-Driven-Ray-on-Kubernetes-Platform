        ## 🐥 Beginner Friendly
        Welcome! This Beginner Issue is designed to be a natural next step after good first issues.
        
        **It nudges you to:**
        - Research existing patterns
        - Own more implementation decisions
        - Test your changes
        
        **Difficulty:**
        - Requires knowledge of our workflow
        - Beginner to intermediate Python/Terraform and Git
        
        **Important:**
        We recommend completing at least 1-2 good first issues before attempting a beginner issue.
