name: Agent Beta — PR Code Review

# Phase 3: Verification — Triggered when a PR with the 'ai-generated' label is opened
# or updated. Beta performs a deep Gemini-powered review (logic integrity, PEP8,
# security, hallucination detection), then either approves+merges or rejects with
# a bulleted change-request comment routing feedback back to Delta.

on:
  pull_request:
    # 'labeled' is the only meaningful trigger: fires when Delta adds 'ai-generated'
    # to the PR after creation. 'opened' and 'synchronize' would fire BEFORE the label
    # exists, so the if-guard below would always evaluate to false.
    types: [labeled]
